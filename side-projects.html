I have done a few side projects in the past in order to learn new things and have fun. 
Here is a list of them:

<h3><a href="https://github.com/miguel-vila/fetch">Fetch</a></h3>

<p>
    A proof of concept about implementing <a href="https://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/haxl-icfp14.pdf">Haxl</a> using Scala.
    Haxl is a library from Facebook that allowed you to batch and cache requests.
    Some recent libraries that have implemented this are <a href="https://github.com/47degrees/fetch">"fetch"</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com/zio/zio-query">"zio-query"</a>.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/miguel-vila/hoja-calculo">Hoja CÃ¡lculo</a></h3>

<p>
    Implemented a collaborative spreadsheet. 
    Used <a href="https://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2015/07/how-to-implement-spreadsheet.html?utm_source=pocket_reader">this blog post</a>
    as a reference to make it reactive (i.e. declare a cell that depends on another).
    In order to make it collaborative I used a CRDT library.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/miguel-vila/incremental-compiler">Incremental Compiler</a></h3>

<p>
    Implemented a toy compiler. Initially, I followed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071216140227/http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/compilers-tutorial-2006-09-16.pdf">this tutorial</a>,
    but did a few things differently. I used <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/an-introduction-to-recursion-schemes/">recursion schemes</a> to implement the compiler.
