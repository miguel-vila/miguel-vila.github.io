I continued with the Scheme interpreter I was writing. I stopped following the [tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) at chapter 9 and decided to try some new things with the REPL. I used [Haskeline](https://github.com/judah/haskeline#haskeline) for adding new features to the REPL. You can write expressions, define and call functions, multiple line commands and autocompletion. This is the general functionality:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/64wx0j07qtdzxxy3bebwrvqv8.js" id="asciicast-64wx0j07qtdzxxy3bebwrvqv8" async></script>

I also added an undo feature: 

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/75ylj8dhiznocwek6tuvs82lh.js" id="asciicast-75ylj8dhiznocwek6tuvs82lh" async></script>

And another option which allows you to edit the command history and replay the commands:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/5ssofynkgnbr5ji4sx6wn9stv.js" id="asciicast-5ssofynkgnbr5ji4sx6wn9stv" async></script>

I decided to stop with that project for now. I guess I can play with it more afterwards, but I want to do other things. Other features that can be somewhat interesting:

* Add support for macros.
* Add support for whatever module system Lisp has.
* In the REPL: highlight the opening parenthesis.
* In the REPL: automatic indentation on multiple lines.

I attended Viabhav's workshop on git internals. You can find the workshop material [here](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/git-internals-workshop/releases), just download one of the releases and do a `git show` to start. I also recommend [Emily Xie's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUCwr1Y6bFI) on the same subject but with a different approach.

Also I attended the Code Dojo and paired with [Marielle](https://github.com/mariellefoster) in [this](https://projecteuler.net/problem=24) project Euler problem. The first thing we could think of was the brute-force solution which incredibly ran in less than 5 seconds. But then, after giving it some though, there is an efficient and clever [solution](https://gist.github.com/miguel-vila/8dc9500ab354a587a2cdc3e48c2ccb36).

I continued following the tutorial on operating systems with the frames allocator part. I

Thursday was the last day for the Summer 2 batch. At the same time this marks the half of the Fall 1 batch, my batch. So I guess this is a point for reflection. One of my main objectives when coming to RC was filling some conceptual gaps I feel I have. Coincidentially this week I stumbled upon [this](http://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/09/15/knowledge-debt/) blog post that articulates precisely that: the idea that as a programmer you may ignore the inner workings of something you use for a while, but sooner or later you will have to understand those . I don't mind moving away from those general objectives I have as long as I'm learning something. Also I'm starting to feel the pressure to define what I'm going to do when this ends: I want to get a job and I know of some options 

* a little about operating systems: paging and frames allocator
* picnic and talks
* a moment to stop and think

* pending things in scheme project:
  * move undo and edit logic to own `ReplCommands` module
  * parenthesis highlighting 
  * automatic indentation on multiple lines
  * macros
  * duplicated logic in `handleLispInputs` and `executeLispInputs`

* mike's tutorial on wireshark
