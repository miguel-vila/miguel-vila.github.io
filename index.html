<h3>I'm Miguel, and I build software that works at scale.</h3>

<p>Over the past decade, I've tackled problems ranging from subscription lifecycle management for Disney+ to semantic
search infrastructure at SiriusXM. I've designed APIs, optimized data pipelines, led migrations, and mentored
teams.</p>

<p>Always focused on delivering real business value.</p>

<p>I'm particularly effective at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking ambiguous requirements and turning them into concrete technical solutions</li>
<li>Designing systems that handle millions of users reliably</li>
<li>Leading cross-functional initiatives from proposal to production</li>
</ul>
